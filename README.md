> Script to Auto Update Plex Media Server on Synology NAS

## Goals

- Make the echoed messages super clear
- Make the version checking logic as smart as possible
- Ensure the script fails if there are any errors
- Ensure temp files are cleaned up properly
- Write bash code as idiomatically as possible
- Attempt to find the "Plex Media Server" directory that contains Preferences.xml efficiently
- Attempt to support all Synology NAS architectures

## Usage

First, SSH into your NAS, save the [update-plex.sh](update-plex.sh) script somewhere and set it as executable:

```sh
$ ssh you@IP_OF_YOUR_NAS
you@yournas:~$ wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cowboy/synology-update-plex/master/update-plex.sh"
you@yournas:~$ chmod a+x update-plex.sh
```

Then, create a Scheduled Task with a User-defined script in the Synology DSM Control Panel:
- Ensure the User is `root`
- Ensure the Run command is `/path/to/plex-update.sh`

## Notes

- This was tested on a Synology DS918+ NAS. It should work with other Synology NAS models. If it doesn't, please file an issue or PR.
- Be careful when SSHing into your NAS. I'm not responsible if you break anything.
- This assumes Plex was installed manually from https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/
- If you have Plex Pass and want to enable beta releases, uncomment the `release_mode=beta` line.
- You'll probably need to [add Plexâ€™s package signing public key to Synology NAS Package Center](https://support.plex.tv/articles/205165858-how-to-add-plex-s-package-signing-public-key-to-synology-nas-package-center/).
